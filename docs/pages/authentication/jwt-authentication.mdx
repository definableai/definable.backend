description: 'How JSON Web Tokens are implemented in Zyeta'
---

Zyeta uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as the primary authentication mechanism, providing a stateless, secure way to verify user identity across API requests.

## What are JWTs?

JSON Web Tokens are an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

In Zyeta, JWTs are used to:
- Authenticate users after login
- Maintain session state without server-side storage
- Pass user identity information securely between services

## JWT Structure

JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots:

```
header.payload.signature
```

### Header
Contains the token type and signing algorithm:

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### Payload
Contains the claims or user data:

```json
{
  "id": "5f8e7d6c-92a4-4c3b-b3e2-f1a7b8d9c0e1",
  "exp": 1619283492  // Expiration timestamp
}
```

### Signature
Ensures the token hasn't been tampered with:

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```

## Implementation in Zyeta

### Token Generation

When a user logs in successfully, the system generates a JWT:

```python
def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: Optional[timedelta] = None) -> str:
    """Create access token."""
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(minutes=15)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, settings.jwt_secret, algorithm="HS256")
    return encoded_jwt
```

The token contains:
- User ID (`id`)
- Expiration time (`exp`)
- No sensitive information like passwords

### Token Validation

Every protected endpoint uses the `JWTBearer` dependency for validation:

```python
class JWTBearer(HTTPBearer):
    def __init__(self, auto_error: bool = True):
        super().__init__(auto_error=auto_error)

    async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[dict]:
        credentials = await super().__call__(request)
        if not credentials or credentials.scheme != "Bearer":
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid authorization")
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(
                credentials.credentials, 
                settings.jwt_secret, 
                algorithms=["HS256"]
            )
            return payload
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid or expired token")
```

This middleware:
1. Extracts the token from the Authorization header
2. Verifies the token signature using the secret key
3. Checks if the token has expired
4. Returns the decoded payload containing user information

## Using JWT in Requests

Client applications must include the JWT in the Authorization header:

```http
GET /api/some-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: api.zyeta.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVmOGU3ZDZjLTkyYTQtNGMzYi1iM2UyLWYxYTdiOGQ5YzBlMSIsImV4cCI6MTYxOTI4MzQ5Mn0.8Kq1MseugX_dnLAT4ZPwTN7wxpY7zLBVyWiYw2ki8a0
```

## JWT and RBAC Integration

JWTs work in conjunction with the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system:

1. The JWT establishes user identity
2. The RBAC middleware uses this identity to determine:
   - The user's role in the requested organization
   - Permissions associated with that role
   - Whether the user can perform the requested action

```python
@app.get("/api/protected")
async def protected_route(
    user: dict = Depends(RBAC("resource", "action"))
):
    # If execution reaches here, the user is authenticated
    # and authorized to access this endpoint
    return {"message": "You have access", "user_id": user["id"]}
```

## JWT Configuration

Zyeta's JWT implementation can be configured through environment variables:

```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60  # Token validity period
```

## WebSocket Authentication

For WebSocket connections, JWTs are passed as query parameters:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://api.zyeta.com/ws?token=your-jwt-token');
```

The server validates these tokens using the same mechanism:

```python
async def __call__(self, websocket: WebSocket = None):
    token = websocket.query_params.get("token")
    if not token:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid authorization")
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.jwt_secret, algorithms=["HS256"])
        return payload
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid or expired token")
```

## Security Considerations

Zyeta's JWT implementation follows these security best practices:

- **Secret Key Protection**: The JWT secret is securely stored and never exposed
- **Short Expiration Times**: Tokens expire quickly to limit the damage of token theft
- **No Sensitive Data**: Tokens never contain sensitive user information
- **HTTPS Only**: JWTs are only transmitted over encrypted connections
- **Signature Validation**: All tokens are cryptographically verified

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Token Error">
    This usually means:
    - The token has expired
    - The token was signed with a different secret
    - The token has been tampered with
    
    Solution: Re-authenticate by logging in again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing Authentication">
    Check that:
    - The Authorization header is included
    - The header uses the format `Bearer <token>`
    - There are no extra spaces or characters
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Token Expired">
    JWTs have a limited lifetime. When expired:
    - The client needs to request a new token
    - If using refresh tokens, use the refresh flow to get a new access token
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
