AI Agents are the core intelligent entities in Definable.ai that can understand natural language, reason about problems, and take actions to help users accomplish their goals. They combine the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools and knowledge bases to create versatile, capable assistants.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI Agent is an autonomous software entity that:
- **Understands** natural language input from users
- **Reasons** about problems using integrated knowledge and context
- **Acts** by calling tools and functions to accomplish tasks
- **Learns** from interactions and improves over time
- **Communicates** results back to users in natural language
