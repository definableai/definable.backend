This guide provides solutions for common issues you may encounter when setting up, developing, or deploying the Definable backend.

## Overview

When troubleshooting issues with the Definable backend, it's helpful to categorize the problem:

## Diagnostic Process

When troubleshooting, follow this general process:

1. **Identify the symptoms** - What exactly is happening? What error messages are you seeing?
2. **Check the logs** - Application logs, database logs, and error messages often contain valuable information
3. **Isolate the problem** - Is it a configuration issue, code bug, or infrastructure problem?
4. **Check for recent changes** - Did the issue appear after a recent code change or environment modification?
5. **Test simple solutions first** - Often, restarting services or clearing caches can resolve issues
6. **Consult documentation** - Check this troubleshooting guide for common solutions

## Logging

The Definable backend uses the `loguru` library for logging. To enable more detailed logs:

```python
# In your local development environment
from loguru import logger
logger.add("debug.log", level="DEBUG")
```

## Getting Support

If you're unable to resolve an issue using this documentation:

1. Check for similar issues in the GitHub repository
2. Contact the development team through the appropriate channels
3. Provide detailed information about the issue, including:
   - Error messages
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Environment details
   - Recent changes to your setup
