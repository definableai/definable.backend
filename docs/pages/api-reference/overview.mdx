description: 'Overview of the Zyeta API endpoints and functionality'
---

The Zyeta API is organized around REST principles, using standard HTTP verbs, returning JSON responses, and using standard HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.zyeta.io
```

For local development, the base URL is:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication. See the [Authentication Guide](/authentication) for details on how to authenticate your requests.

## Response Format

Responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses typically include:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

Error responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {} // Optional additional details
  }
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:

| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 200  | OK - The request was successful |
| 201  | Created - A new resource was successfully created |
| 400  | Bad Request - The request was invalid |
| 401  | Unauthorized - Authentication failed or not provided |
| 403  | Forbidden - The authenticated user doesn't have permission |
| 404  | Not Found - The requested resource doesn't exist |
| 422  | Unprocessable Entity - Validation error |
| 429  | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500  | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on the server |

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure stability and fair usage. The current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute per IP address
- 1000 requests per hour per authenticated user

Rate limit headers are included in all API responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1620000000
```

## Pagination

For endpoints that return lists of items, the API uses cursor-based pagination. Parameters:

- `limit`: Number of items to return (default: 20, max: 100)
- `cursor`: Cursor for pagination (obtained from previous responses)

Paginated responses include:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    // Items here
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_cursor": "next_page_cursor",
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

The Zyeta API is organized into the following categories:
